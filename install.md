# Setup requirements for the Studiosity block plugin.

The only requirements for the Studiosity block to work, is to set up a site level External Tool with your organizations client details. The instructions to do this are below. The block the course activity it creates, will use the configuration of the site-level tool.

It is also encouraged to configure the main graphic image of the block. Currently, there is a fallback image but this may disappear in the future.

## Setup a site-level Studiosity External Tool.

1. **Goto** Site administration. 
2. **Click** the *Plugins* tab. 
3. Under the *Activity modules* section, **click** on the link *Manage tools* that is directly below *External tool*. 
4. **Click** the link *configure a tool manually*. 
5. Fill in the details for the Studiosity tool. 
6. **Click** *Save changes*.

Now when you add the Studiosity block, it will automatically create a hidden Studiosity LTI activity with these configurations in the course.
